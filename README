# Speedy

Benchmarking various implementations of the same function to find the fastest implementation.

I have done similar things before, see:
- https://github.com/artInLines/reverser (incorporated into mem-reverse)
- https://github.com/artInLines/SIMD-demo
- https://github.com/ArtInLines/daily-tasks

The major inspiration for this was Casey Muratori's "Computer Enhance" Course (https://www.computerenhance.com/)

# Quickstart

See `mem-copy` and `mem-reverse` folder respectively.

Note: Make sure to download the submodule [ail](https://github.com/artInLines/ail) as well, by running `git submodule update --init`

To be done...

# Structure

Each folder (except for `./util`) contains a seperate program/function to be optimized.
